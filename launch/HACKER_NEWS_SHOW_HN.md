Show HN: CR AudioViz AI – AI creative tools where credits actually never expire

---

**Post Body:**

Hey HN,

I'm Roy. My wife Cindy and I built CR AudioViz AI (https://craudiovizai.com) because we were frustrated with how creative AI tools treat their users.

**The Problem:**

The creative tool space is fragmented and predatory:
- Subscriptions stack up fast
- Credits expire (use it or lose it)
- Mistakes cost you money
- You don't own what you create
- Switching costs are high

**Our Approach:**

We built a comprehensive platform with a different philosophy:

1. **Credits never expire** on paid plans. Not "roll over for 30 days." Never.

2. **Automatic error refunds.** If our AI fails, you get credits back automatically.

3. **You own everything.** Code, content, exports—it's yours. Host it anywhere.

4. **One platform.** Documents, graphics, audio, video, business tools—integrated, not siloed.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (TypeScript strict mode)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- Vercel (edge deployment)
- Multi-AI routing (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

**Business Model:**
- Freemium with paid tiers ($19/$49/$199/mo)
- 17% discount for annual plans
- No VC funding—revenue-focused from day one

**Why We're Different:**

We're also building 20 "Social Impact Modules" for communities that get ignored: veterans, first responders, animal rescues, faith organizations. We're pursuing grants ($600M+ pipeline) to subsidize access for these groups.

**Current Status:**
- Platform is live and ~95% complete
- 15 revenue-ready applications
- Javari AI assistant (adaptive, context-aware)

I'd love feedback on the product and our approach. What would make you switch from your current tools?

AMA about the tech, business model, or anything else.
